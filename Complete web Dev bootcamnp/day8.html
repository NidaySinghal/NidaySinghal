    <h1>Ids and Classes</h1>
    <p>"id" and "class" are two diffrent attributes that is used to give tag a specific identity, you can give same "class" to many tags but "id" should be strictly diffrent for every tag. There is a shortcut to give a new "div" tag its "id" and "class"... you can type "." then your desired "class" name and type "#" and then your desired "id" and then hitting enter will give your blank "div" container that has your desired "id" and "class".</p>
    <p>Giving "id" and "class" to every tag will help you to target multiple or specific tags according to your need and make changes in it in CSS files.</p>
